## Lottie Viewer JS



A Lottie JSON animation viewer, made in JS and HTML.

## Current features

- `.JSON` playback and exporting

- Speed control

- Animated playback indication

- Playing controls

- Console error debugging(can be useful if you think that some parts of the page won't load properly)

- Support for all platforms(assuming you have a web browser)

- Offline support(as long as you open it before running offline)


Unlike most Lottie animation players that run in the browser, this version can run locally without the need for a locally hosted web server.

The UI is *highly* animated, and is meant to be simple to use(assuming that you know what Lottie is).

If you have a questions or a feature request, open an issue! I will try my best to solve/respond to all of them.
